    </h2> 
    <p>The end of the year is a good time to step back and take stock of everything
accomplished throughout the past 365 days. This software development
year in review post continues the retrospectives I performed in
<a class="reference external" href="/2012-development-year-in-review.html">2012</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/2013-development-year-in-review.html">2013</a> and

<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h2>2015 Highlights</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Writing and releasing my first book,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.deploypython.com/">The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments</a></li>
<li>Expanding <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/">fullstackpython.com</a>'s
content with
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/commits/gh-pages">many open source code commits</a> while growing the audience from 18,000 to over
55,000 readers per month</li>
<li>Speaking at PyCon US with both Renee Chu and Kate Heddleston</li>
<li>Presenting my all time favorite tech talk at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/219577721/">SF Python</a>:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5YQbNrFfyw">Asynchronous Python Web Apps with WebSockets and gevent</a>,
which was all live-coded except for a few introduction slides</li>
<li>Working with the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF129ioe8kc">Twilio Developer Network</a>
to execute the incredible
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/signal">Signal 2015 developers conference</a></li>
<li>Creating and deploying the initial version of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/plapi">The Programming Languages Web API (Plapi)</a>
(along with working on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/plapi-prototype-flask">Flask prototype</a>),
which will be my primary 2016 side project</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding">
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>All of my technical writing is based on open source coding projects.
Typically I start a project prototype with a fury of programming in a couple
of days or weeks. Then I'll write a blog post on it. In some cases, that's
the end of both the programming and writing unless there are bugs found or
unexpected questions asked by the community that make me want to take the
project further.</p>
<p>In other cases, the initial code is a foundation for a larger effort
that weaves coding, writing and speaking together. In these cases, such
as with <a class="reference external" href="http://codingacrossamerica.com/">Coding Across America</a>,
Full Stack Python, Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations, The Full
Stack Python Guide to Deployments and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.plapi.io">Plapi</a>,
I seek a fast feedback loop based on in-person and online conversations,
pull requests, GitHub issues, online comments, emails and tweets.
Updates are made based on the feedback received.</p>
<p>These are some of the projects that followed the community feedback
formula that will continue in 2016:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Started <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks">comparing Python web frameworks</a>
to expand beyond my typical
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html">Django</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html">Flask</a> frameworks usage</li>
<li>Created an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fsp-deployment-guide">open source Ansible playbook</a>
for deploying WSGI applications as a companion to my deployments book</li>
<li>Wrote a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/plapi-prototype-flask">Plapi prototype with Flask and Flask-RESTful</a>
then began the version 1 codebase with
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/plapi">Django and Django REST Framework</a></li>
<li>Updated the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/twilio_module.html">Twilio Ansible module</a>
to support <a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/mms">multimedia messages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the above projects moving forward I try to make an improvement and
Git commit every day to at least one of them. In 2014, I missed 3 days out
of 365. This year I missed 2 days, which snapped my 505 day commit streak
but is still crazy in how consistent I was able to be despite my intense
travel schedule. There were several hundred more private commits but here
is how the public commit chart turned out:</p>
<img alt="GitHub commits for 2015" src="/source/static/img/151230-year-review/github-commits.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>The vast majority of the above commits were Python code. I probably wrote
85% of my code in Python (although some subset of that is JavaScript on the
front end when necessary) and about 15% in Swift. That ratio will ideally
change in 2016 to about 65% Python and 35% Swift, with far more of the
Swift code as open source than I was able to accomplish this year.</p>
<p>I also started <a class="reference external" href="/live-coding.html">live code streaming</a> in the second
half of this year on both Livecoding.tv and Twitch Creative. The dozen
streams added up to about 18 hours of video. There is still a lot of work to
figure out how well these platforms work. However, the initial results
are encouraging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing">
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>The majority of my technical writing this year was for
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/mmakai">Twilio</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http:///www.deploypython.com/">my Python deployments book</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/">Full Stack Python</a>. My goal in writing
is to be accessible to developers of all skill levels. I skew towards
pragmatic projects and much of my writing boils down to &quot;<em>try out this
tutorial and you'll learn x, y and z</em>&quot;. My 2015 Twilio blog posts closely
followed this formula:</p>

</ul>
<p>These tutorials are solid executions of inspiring and equipping fellow
software developers that I look forward to continuing to write in 2016.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="speaking">
<h2>Speaking</h2>
<p>My technical talks delivery was a tale of two halves in 2015. The first half of
the year I gave one of my favorite talks ever at
SF Python called
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5YQbNrFfyw">Async Python Web Apps with WebSockets and gevent</a>.
The aspect I enjoyed the most about this talk was that it was almost all lived
coded and there were several sections where the audience could interact with what
I was building.</p>
<p>In April I was fortunate enough to have two incredible speaking partners in Kate
Heddleston and Renee Chu for two PyCon US talks. Both talks went well. However,
afterwards I was exhausted and realized that over the past couple of years I gave
over fifty full length talks. Most of those talks were new or customized for the
audience since that's what typically produces the best results for the folks who
are taking time to listen to what you have to say. It's difficult to keep that
pace though so I significantly cut back as I moved from DC to SF in June.</p>
<p>There hasn't been a subject that I've been excited enough to get back into crafting
a new talk. I still give plenty of live coded demos and shorter talks but for now
I'm going to chill on tech talks to focus on coding Plapi and writing Full Stack
Python.</p>

<div class="section" id="onward">
<h2>Onward</h2>
<p>It's been a good year across my major focus areas in software development. 2016
will be another solid year of learning, growth and software delivery. For more on
that, check out my
