        <a href="/2016-software-development-year-review.html">My 2016 Software Development Year in Review</a>
    </h2> 
    <p>In the past several years I have taken time at the end of December to
reflect on the coding projects, software talks and tutorials
that I worked on throughout the year. It is useful to have an account of my
software development highlights even though I do not expect this type of
post to necessarily be riveting retrospectives for most readers. They are
just an honest retrospective on what worked, didn't work and how I can get
better going forward.</p>
<p>This post differs slightly from past retrospectives in
<a class="reference external" href="/2012-development-year-in-review.html">2012</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/2013-development-year-in-review.html">2013</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/2014-software-development-year-review.html">2014</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="/2015-software-development-year-review.html">2015</a>
by starting with a big picture summary before diving into the highlights
for what I created. I also wrote a forward-looking post on
<a class="reference external" href="2016-year-ahead-software-development.html">my year ahead in software development</a>
to kick off this year so I'll take a look at how my results stacked up
to what I was expecting to accomplish.</p>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2016 was my first complete calendar year as a software developer in San
Francisco. Without looking too far ahead into 2017, it will also be my last
year here as I am moving back to Washington, DC in April to continue the
work with Twilio that I started there in 2014.</p>
<p>Overall I made progress on becoming a better Swift &amp; iOS developer.
My work continued on the Python projects that are important to me while
also learning a bit more about the Bottle, Pyramid and Morepath web
frameworks to branch out from my usual
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html">Django</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html">Flask</a> work.
I invested significant time into live streaming programming and creating
tutorial videos to put onto YouTube.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expectations-vs-results">
<h2>Expectations vs. Results</h2>
<p>My four goals were stated in
<a class="reference external" href="/2016-year-ahead-software-development.html">my 2016 year ahead in software development</a> as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Code, launch and operate my 2016 side project Plapi</li>
<li>Inspire and equip fellow developers as a Twilio Developer Evangelist</li>
<li>Release new updates to The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments book</li>
<li>Build on the Full Stack Python foundation with daily updates</li>
</ol>
<p>Goal #1 to code, launch and operate the Programming Languages Web API was a
semi-bust. I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattmakai/plapi">decent initial version</a> and deployed it on a Linode server. However, I fell on my face
while trying to operate it. Essentially, the operations did not happen.
There really needed to be daily updates to the content and code for
this project to take off. In the late spring the whole thing was shelved
when Michael Kennedy and I started working on
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-for-entrepreneurs-video-course">the Python for Entrepreneurs video course</a>.</p>
<p>I will have to take another swing at building this programming languages
web API again when I am more firmly committed to the project.</p>
<p>Goal #2 to continue inspiring and equipping developers as a Twilio Developer
Evangelist was solid. Twilio is a special company completely focused on
developers. I am just as stoked while entering my fourth year as a Twilion
as the day I joined.</p>
<p>Goal #3 was to release several
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.deploypython.com/">Guide to Deployments book</a> updates. There
was significant progress in the book toolchain, creation of the .mobi
version and some content updates and tweaks. However, I really aim to get
out an update each month or every other month at the least. In 2017 I need
to do better to crank out regular meaty updates and keep the book's
instructions fresh.</p>
<p>Goal #4 to continue building Full Stack Python with daily updates was very
successful. While I did not deliver updates every single day, I was
intentional in the days I would not commit a code change because I needed
a break due to vacation or work commitments. I'm happy how this one turned
out with the addition of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog.html">new tutorials blog</a>, a
revamped
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html">table of contents that includes a roadmap for upcoming pages</a>
significantly reduced HTML+CSS file sizes and a ton of additional content
across many new pages. Crossing the 800,000 reader mark for the year is also
a good stepping stone towards my 1+ million readers target in 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding">
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I did a lot of coding this past year but a lot of it didn't feel as meaty
as some projects I worked on for extended periods of time when I was a
consultant in my pre-Twilio days.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spent significant time coding Python projects, both open source and some private side prototype projects</li>
<li>Developed with Swift and released a small iOS mobile app on the App Store</li>
<li>Coded occasionally on Windows with both Python and Java</li>
</ul>
<p>Here was my GitHub commit log throughout the year, including both public
and private repositories.</p>
<img alt="GitHub commits for 2016" src="/source/static/img/161225-2016-year-review/contributions-2016.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>I'll need to think about longer-term projects in 2017 to make sure I do
not get stuck spending all my time constantly creating new projects rather
than maintaining and building upon existing ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing">
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>My writing is split between several locations, including the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog">Twilio blog</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/">Full Stack Python</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mattmakai.com/">this personal blog you're reading right now</a>
and any outside sites I have the opportunity to write for, such as
Real Python this year or O'Reilly's site in past years.</p>
<div class="section" id="twilio-posts">
<h3>Twilio posts</h3>
<p>I wrote less Twilio posts than I would've like to put out there, but the
resulting list is decent.</p>

<h3>Other Posts</h3>
<p>I wrote a post for the guys who run one of my favorite Python sites,
<a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a>, on
<a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/getting-started-with-the-slack-api-using-python-and-flask/">Getting Started with the Slack API</a>.</p>
<p>My personal blog only had three posts, the look ahead for 2016, this year
in review post and a
<a class="reference external" href="/r2d2-skynet.html">summary of my SIGNAL 2016 talk on bots</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="book-updates">
<h3>Book updates</h3>
<p>Daily updates to Full Stack Python, including the blog posts listed above,
along with one major update to The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments
were the highlights on the book update side. There is a lot of work to be
done in 2017 with more frequent updates to the Guide to Deployments book
to improve it based on reader feedback.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="streaming-and-videos">
<h2>Streaming and Videos</h2>
<p>I started streaming on Livecoding.tv at the end of 2015 and then moved over
to Twitch Creative for the first six months of 2016. Finally I switched to
creating videos for YouTube and the Python for Entrepreneurs video course.
The two public videos I created were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qakG9BYJ1tw">First Steps with Python and Bottle</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy13mDsXC4s">Localhost Tunneling with Ngrok on Mac OS X</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the videos I created are in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Git chapter on the Python for
Entrepreneurs course page</a>. I have a
lot more videos coming in 2017 and that will be one focus area for me
heading into the new year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="worked-worked">
<h2>Worked / !Worked</h2>
<p>On the Twilio Developer Network we constantly use a simeple
&quot;worked / ! worked&quot; tool for critical self-reflection after rehearsing
and executing. We start with everything that worked for us then follow it up
with what didn't go as well that we may want to improve. Here are my worked
bits for 2016:</p>
<p><em>Worked</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Continued daily work on Full Stack Python</li>
<li>Reasonable technical tutorial output on multiple sites</li>
<li>Took time at the end of 2016 to stop and reflect on my work</li>
<li>Coded and learned way more in Swift &amp; iOS development than any prior year</li>
<li>Became fully comfortable switching between Django, Flask and Bottle</li>
<li>Grew Full Stack Python to over 80,000 readers each month</li>
<li>Started Python for Entrepreneurs and ran successful Kickstarter with Michael Kennedy</li>
<li>Established a solid position to finish Python for Entrepreneurs course in early 2017</li>
<li>Had a better work/life balance in fall 2016 than 2015</li>
</ul>
<p><em>!Worked</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Not yet fully comfortable with using Pyramid for web development</li>
<li>Did not produce enough book updates for readers</li>
<li>Overall did not spend enough time coding, especially on complicated projects</li>
<li>Did not do enough technical talks throughout the year</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="onward">
<h2>Onward!</h2>
<p>That's my long list of what I achieved, didn't achieve and some insight into
what I hope to do better for 2017. Next up I'll do a short post sometime in
the next few weeks that will look ahead towards my goals for the new year.</p>
