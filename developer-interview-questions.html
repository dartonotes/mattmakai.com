        <a href="/developer-interview-questions.html">Developer Interview Questions</a>
    </h2> 
    <p>One of my clients was interviewing web developers and asked me about how
I go about performing technical interviews. I have interviewed 15
developers of all experience levels for
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.excella.com/">Excella Consulting</a> in the past year. My style
and questions are still developing. This morning when I read
<a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/on-startups/4c0197625f69">Facebook Lost A Great Engineer</a>
I felt like it might help my learning process if I synthesized my thoughts
with a blog post.</p>
<p>There are different interviewing philosophies so this is my opinionated
perspective.</p>
<div class="section" id="open-source">
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Before an interview I always check out if a person has open
source projects on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>. If they don't, that's a huge
black mark to me. I do know some really great engineers who do not use Git
and do not have open source work to their name. In general though I am
very leary of anyone who does not have some sort of public project or website.
I need time to peruse their code outside that one hour interview. That process
helps me understand how someone approaches problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="behavioral-questions">
<h2>Behavioral Questions</h2>
<p>Once the interview begins I start by asking a mix of behavioral questions to
determine what roles a person has performed on a team. The behavioral
questions also help to discover what a candidate's strengths and
weaknesses may be. For example, &quot;Tell me a time you were developing
software with a team.&quot; They give a bit of background then I ask simple
followup questions. &quot;What went right about the project?&quot; &quot;What could have
been improved?&quot; &quot;What was the most difficult technical challenge you faced
and how did you overcome it?&quot;</p>
<p>Simple questions of that nature to help the candidate get loosened up a
little bit - there's no &quot;wrong&quot; answers because it draws on their own
experiences. I watch out for people that pass a lot of blame around -
&quot;so and so didn't do their job, I had to fix everything&quot; - even if that
truly happened, it's a sign of team dysfunction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-questions">
<h2>Technical Questions</h2>
<p>That's pretty standard stuff so far. Once we get past some initial
questions which allow me to determine if they can communicate,
whether they work well with a team, what their general technical
interests are, I ask some blanket, open-ended technical questions. Here
are some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Explain to me what happens when a user enters a URL into a browser to
go to a website.&quot; - web developers should understand the HTTP
request/response cycle, a bit about browser rendering (WebKit, Mozilla,
IE, etc), what happens in what order, and something about how the
server does the processing. This is a great question because the
candidate can give an overview and then go into further detail to
show their level of competency. They can talk about domain name
resolution, TCP/IP/HTTP networking stack, etc.</li>
<li>&quot;Describe the parts of your ideal web application stack. Tell me what
goes into your thought process in picking out which pieces to use on
projects.&quot; This is in line with the website I created at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/">Full Stack Python</a>. If a candidate
can tell me about MySQL, Redis, some web frameworks and WHY they make
sense in some situations and not others that's good. I try to filter
out &quot;well this is what I've used in the past so that's what I'm going to
pick.&quot; I want to work with developers that really think about why they
use various pieces in the stack puzzle. It also allows me to find out if
a candidate is using interesting new tools on side projects outside their
day job.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-i-do-not-do">
<h2>What I Do Not Do</h2>
<p>I never ask &quot;teaser&quot; or puzzle questions like they do at Facebook.
I don't feel like puzzle questions are highly correlated enough with
filtering out if a person is going to be a &quot;gets stuff done&quot; type of
developer. Facebook and Google probably have better luck with those
questions since it fits their culture.</p>
<p>To me most puzzles are a waste of time. I would rather be solving real
client and customer business problems by using technology. This is my
philosophy - not judgment on the cultures where puzzle interviews
are prevalent. If that works for them that's great. I just would not
fit in well in that culture. It's likely that the people I want on my
development teams would feel the same way so that's the path I take.</p>
