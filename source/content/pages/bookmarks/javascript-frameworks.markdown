# JavaScript Frameworks
JavaScript frameworks push much of the complexity one confined to the server
side onto the client's JavaScript engine. The advantages are a more responsive
user interface when done correctly. However, JavaScript frameworks are still
under heavy development and there is currently no indictation of which ones
will become abandoned and which others will be the new Rails or Django widely
supported frameworks.
