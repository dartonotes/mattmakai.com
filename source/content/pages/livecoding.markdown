If you're joining from the 
[livecoding.tv stream](https://livecoding.tv/mattmakai), here's a little 
background info for context.

Typically one of these three open source projects are being streamed:

1. [Comparing Python Web Frameworks](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison), 
   where we build the same example Python web application in as many 
   [web frameworks](http://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) as
   possible to compare and contrast the frameworks. Frameworks
   such as [Django](http://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html), 
   [Flask](http://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html),
   [Bottle](http://www.fullstackpython.com/bottle.html) and
   [Morepath](http://www.fullstackpython.com/morepath.html) are in progress
   before we continue on to
   [other ones](http://www.fullstackpython.com/other-web-frameworks.html).

1. [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/), which primarily 
   involves researching and writing content along with some basic coding
   with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) and 
   [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) templates.
   
1. [PLAPI](https://github.com/makaimc/plapi), a web API for programming
   languages written in Python with Django and Django REST Framework.


## About Me
I'm a 
[Twilio Developer Evangelist](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html) 
based in San Francisco, CA and I mostly code in Python and Swift.

Recently I wrote a book on [Python deployments](http://www.deploypython.com/).

## Past sessions
Here's a rundown of what I covered in previous live coding sessions. Click on the
title to go to the video capture from that session.

### [Python + Django Web App Development](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/python-django-web-app-development/)
Streamed on Wed, September 30, 2015.

* Chatted a bit about Django and Websockets.

* Started [Django project for compare Python web frameworks](https://github.com/makaimc/compare-python-web-frameworks/tree/master/django_defaults).



### [Python Web Apps: Bottle, Django & Morepath](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/python-web-apps-bottle-django-morepath/)
Streamed on Friday, September 25, 2015.

* Finished up the 
  [Bottle](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison/tree/master/bottle_sqlalchemy)
  implementation of the web app.

* Started working on the 
  [Morepath](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison/tree/master/morepath_sqlalchemy)
  version, but did not get a prototype working just yet. To be continued.


### [Teaching Python Web Dev (Flask & Bottle)](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/teaching-python-web-dev-flask-bottle/)
Streamed on Thursday, September 24, 2015. 

* Started out working on the Flask app within the
  [Python web framework comparison](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison)
  project to clean up the UI and fix a couple of bugs.

* Moved over to the 
  [Bottle](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison/tree/master/bottle_sqlalchemy)
  app and built the basic application along with delete and calling. Left
  form handling for next streaming time.


### [Vim-Fu and Python](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/vim-fu-and-python/)
Streamed on Sunday, September 13, 2015.

* Messed around with [Vim](http://www.fullstackpython.com/vim.html) plugin
  managers and plugins.

* Worked with [Flask](http://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) and 
  [Bottle](http://www.fullstackpython.com/bottle.html) in the
  [Python web frameworks comparison repo](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison).


### [Comparing Python Web Frameworks](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/comparing-python-web-frameworks-5/)

* Built the initial Flask application in the
  [Python web frameworks comparison project](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison).
