If you're joining from the 
[livecoding.tv stream](https://livecoding.tv/mattmakai), here's a little 
background info for context.

Typically one of these three open source projects are being streamed:

1. [Comparing Python Web Frameworks](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison), where we
   build the same example Python web application in as many 
   [web frameworks](http://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) as
   possible to compare and contrast the frameworks. Frameworks
   such as [Django](http://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html), 
   [Flask](http://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html),
   [Bottle](http://www.fullstackpython.com/bottle.html) and
   [Morepath](http://www.fullstackpython.com/morepath.html) are in progress
   before we continue on to
   [other ones](http://www.fullstackpython.com/other-web-frameworks.html).

1. [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/), which primarily 
   involves researching and writing content along with some basic coding
   with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) and 
   [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) templates.
   
1. [PLAPI](https://github.com/makaimc/plapi), a web API for programming
   languages written in Python with Django and Django REST Framework.


## About Me
I'm a 
[Twilio Developer Evangelist](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html) 
based in San Francisco, CA and I mostly code in Python and Swift.

Recently I wrote a book on [Python deployments](http://www.deploypython.com/).

## Past sesssions
Here's a rundown of what I covered in previous sessions with a links to
the videos.

### Sept 24, 2015
* Started out working on the Flask app within the
  [Python web framework comparison](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison)
  project to clean up the UI and fix a couple of bugs.

* Moved over to the 
  [Bottle](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison/tree/master/bottle_sqlalchemy)
  app and built the basic application along with delete and calling. Left
  form handling for next streaming time.
