If you're joining from the 
[livecoding.tv stream](https://livecoding.tv/mattmakai), here's a little 
background info for context.

Typically one of these three open source projects are being streamed:

1. [Comparing Python Web Frameworks](https://github.com/makaimc/python-web-framework-comparison), where we
   build the same example Python web application in as many 
   [web frameworks](http://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) as
   possible to compare and contrast the frameworks. Frameworks
   such as [Django](http://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html), 
   [Flask](http://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html),
   [Bottle](http://www.fullstackpython.com/bottle.html) and
   [Morepath](http://www.fullstackpython.com/morepath.html) are in progress
   before we continue on to
   [other ones](http://www.fullstackpython.com/other-web-frameworks.html).

1. [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/), which primarily 
   involves researching and writing content along with some basic coding
   with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) and 
   [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) templates.
   
1. [PLAPI](https://github.com/makaimc/plapi), a web API for programming
   languages written in Python with Django and Django REST Framework.
