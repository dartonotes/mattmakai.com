* Bought an [Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/watch/). Oh my.
* Dictionaries use the `[]` symbols, which is confusing coming from Python
  where you'd use `{}`.
* `&&` is used to combine `if` conditionals and `||` are used to perform OR
  on conditionals. Again, different from using the `and` and `or` keywords.
* `Bool` is the boolean variable type, `true` and `false` are the values,
  with lowercase charaters for the first letters on the values.
* `else if` is how to define else if in if conditionals, rather than `elif`
  in Python.

* A [Swift protocol](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html)
  is conceptually equivalent to a Java interface. A Swift class that *adopts*
  a protocol *conforms* to the protocol. 
* A class can adopt zero, one or many protocols.
