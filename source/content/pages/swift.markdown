* Bought an [Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/watch/). Oh my.

* A [Swift protocol](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html)
  is conceptually equivalent to a Java interface. A Swift class that *adopts*
  a protocol *conforms* to the protocol. 
* A class can adopt zero, one or many protocols.
