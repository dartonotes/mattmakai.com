Recent Writing

Recently I have been writing content on other places around the Web. Here's a
quick summary of what I've been up to.

The majority of my work has been on 
`Full Stack Python <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_, which I update every
day with new sections, resources and explanations for all layers of the Python
web stack.

There are three blog posts on `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com/>`_'s blog as 
well as one on 
`O'Reilly's Programming Blog <http://programming.oreilly.com/>`_:

* `Introducing Developer Evangelist Matt Makai <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html>`_
  is my introductory blog post. I write about D.C.'s current mistake-avoidance
  culture and the perils of not stretching yourself professionally because
  you're too afraid to fail at anything.

* `Ansible Text Message Notifications with Twilio SMS <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/05/ansible-text-messages-notifications-with-twilio-sms.html>`_
  is a detailed walkthrough for the Twilio notifications module in core 
  `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/home>`_ as of the 
  `1.6 release <http://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-1.6-adds-30-new-modules>`_ 
  that came out in May.

* `How To Set Up GitHub Activity SMS Alerts <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/05/github-pull-request-sms-alerts.html>`_
  is a short guide for adding SMS notifications to GitHub pull requests with
  Twilio and Zapier. It's a handy trick I use on Full Stack Python to ensure
  I respond to new requests in a timely fashion.

* `Driving demand for full stack developers <http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/05/driving-demand-for-full-stack-developers.html>`_
  is my most recent post and first time on the O'Reilly Programming Blog.
  I enjoyed thinking about the full stack trend and writing about it. I may
  reconsider my positions taken in that post at some point. For now though I 
  do believe the proliferation of mature open source projects, APIs and
  infrastructure-as-code as major trends that allow talented developers to
  produce entire professional applications themselves with scope that would've
  been impossible as little as 5 years ago.

There are several other posts in the works. However, much of my focus lately
has been on producing content for technical talks. In particular, I'm looking
forward to my 
`Full Stack Python talk at EuroPython <https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/schedule/sessions/41/>`_ 
in Berlin on July 22nd.
