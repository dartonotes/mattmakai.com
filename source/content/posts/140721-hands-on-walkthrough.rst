Favoring Hands On Walkthroughs

Tomorrow I'm giving a talk at 
`EuroPython <https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/>`_ called
`Full Stack Python <https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/schedule/sessions/41/>`_
which is named after my Full Stack Python website. I'm stoked to give the 
talk. I would not have flown thousands of miles
from the US if I wasn't excited (ok fine, I also really wanted to see Berlin).

I am noticing a trend though at conferences that's making me think 
about how I want to approach further events. The trend is the excessive 
reduction in time for speaking slots. Tomorrow's talk will only be 25 minutes.
That's barely enough time to present the Python web application stack topics
at a very high level. I've had to rip out much of the best material which has 
actual code examples and further diagrams to meet the tight time limit.

Many conferences are now shortening talk times to 20 minutes or even
10 minutes. That length is simply not enough time to tell a cohert story, 
clearly articulate new technical concepts, step through diagrams to visually
explain topics and perform a live code demonstration. And that's okay - 
conference organizers should absolutely do what's best for their audience 
and event. Many also topics don't need to use all those methods for the 
audience to learn the subject matter. 


Yet lately the topics I'm most interested in require more time to dive 
into the technical details. Which is why I am beginning to prefer teaching 
through hands on walkthroughs for the audience in a tutorial session than a 
brief talk. I've found audiences learn the most from hands on walkthroughs in a 
tutorial even if sessions take correspondingly more time than two or three 
traditional talks.

For the remainder of 2014 I'll still do the occasional shorter duration
technical talk. However, my hypothesis is that I can help audiences learn
more about technical subjects through them participating in hands on 
walkthroughs at tutorial sessions than time crunched technical talks.
