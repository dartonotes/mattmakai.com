The 
`first part of my multi-part series <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/website-sms-alerts-with-the-plushcap-python-package-part-1.html>`_
with a detailed walkthrough for building the 
`Plushcap Python package <https://github.com/mattmakai/plushcap>`_ 
for website monitoring and alerting is up on the 
`Twilio <https://twilio.com/>`_ blog. 

Plushcap, named after the 
`Neotropical bird <http://neotropical.birds.cornell.edu/portal/species/overview?p_p_spp=589676>`_, 
is a simple open source package for monitoring and
alerting when a website is erroring or not responding to HTTP requests.

Part two in the series will show how to use Plushcap with a task queue. 
Part three will build out the 
`plushcap-flask <https://github.com/mattmakai/plushcap-flask>`_ front end
dashboard to view a website's uptime over extended periods.
