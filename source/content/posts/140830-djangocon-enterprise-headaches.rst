The following list is a collection of resources for solving many of the
headaches that come with using a dynamically typed language like Python
in the enterprise with Django as a commonly misunderstood web framework.
These resources I found very helpful when I found them during my time 
consulting on numerous enterprise Django apps across commercial, non-profit
and government clients before joining Twilio. These links also go along 
with my 
`How to Solve Django's Top 5 Enterprise Headaches </presentations/2014-djangocon-top-5-enterprise.html>`_
talk presented at 
`DjangoCon 2014 <http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/10/>`_.


Integrating with Active Directory
---------------------------------
* Use `python-ldap <http://www.python-ldap.org/>`_ to integrate with
  Active Directory.

* Here's a 
  `snippet for working with Active Directory and the User object <https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2604/>`_
  so the User model can be updated each time a user authenticates.

* This 
  `post on custom Django User models <http://www.roguelynn.com/words/django-custom-user-models/>`_ 
  is helpful for understanding how to integrate with external authentication
  mechanisms.
