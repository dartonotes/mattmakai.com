The following list is a collection of resources for solving many of the
headaches that come with using a dynamically typed language like Python
in the enterprise with Django as a commonly misunderstood web framework.
These resources I found very helpful when I found them during my time 
consulting on numerous enterprise Django apps across commercial, non-profit
and government clients before joining Twilio. These links also go along 
with my 
`How to Solve Django's Top 5 Enterprise Headaches </presentations/2014-djangocon-top-5-enterprise.html>`_
talk presented at 
`DjangoCon 2014 <http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/10/>`_.
