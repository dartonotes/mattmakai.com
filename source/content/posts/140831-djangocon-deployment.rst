The following list is a collection of resources for Django deployments and
scenarios like handling web security vulnerabilities, measuring user traction" 
with web analytics, improving web application performance with caching and 
managing incoming feature requests from users.

Many of these resources along with more detailed explanations can be found on 
`Full Stack Python <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_.

These links go along with our 
`Choose Your Own Django Deployment Adventure </presentations/2014-djangocon-deployment.html>`_ talk.
