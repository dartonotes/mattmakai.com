This post contains links and references that go along with a short talk
I gave at MoDev about 
`the "full stack" development trend </presentations/2014-full-stack-python-perspective.html>`_.

Several blog posts were influential in the early formation of the term
"full stack". Start by reading these to understand where the term 
originated.

* `What is a full stack developer? <http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/>`_ 
  is the canonical "here are the layers a developer should understand to
  call herself full stack" post.
* Way back in 2010, Brad Feld mentioned 
  `full stack developers <http://www.feld.com/archives/2010/12/just-make-it-faster.html>`_
  as critical to tech startups quickly delivering software.


The following are some other great blog posts for additional perspective.

* `The Myth of the Full Stack Developer <http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html>`_
  is an important counterpoint to a lot of the full stack FUD that gets
  spewed by those who do not understand the topic.

* `What is a full-stack web developer after all? <http://edward-designer.com/web/full-stack-web-developer/>`_ 
  provides some further insight into the numerous roles that are out there
  and the convergence of design and front end development.


I created the following resources, one for O'Reilly and one independently
for the Python community. Full Stack Python has now been read by over
100,000 developers so far in 2014.

* My O'Reilly Media post on `Driving Demand for Full Stack Developers <http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/05/driving-demand-for-full-stack-developers.html>`_.

* `Full Stack Python <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_. My 2014 project
  (I pick a major project each year to work on. This follows 2013's
  `Coding Across America <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/>`_).

Web APIs are incredibly important in the full stack trend. If you'd like to
read more about APIs and web fundamentals
`I have a blog post specifically for those resources </links-learning-web-fundamentals.html>`_.
