In college, I was never one to take adderal or ritalin to cram all night before
an exam. That no-sleep study route sounded miserable to me. I was the 
unusual student who slowly and steadily worked every single day in the 
library towards inevitable midterms and finals. Nevertheless, increasing 
brain creativity and focus through exercise, meditation, drugs and 
supplements fascinates me. 

From what I've read, brain research indicates that exercise and meditation 
are safe and highly effective ways to increase performance. Evidence trends 
towards positive performance via caffeine, electrical stimulation and 
tyrosine. However, each one of these must be used properly and their effects 
can potentially diminish over time.

Below are links to some of the resources I've found most useful while 
learning about ways to stimulate increased brain creativity and focus.


Exercise
--------
* `Walking improves creativity <http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/april/walking-vs-sitting-042414.html>`_
  is a Stanford study that showed how creativity, as measured by high-quality,
  novel analogies was increased by walking in the control group.

* `Why walking helps us think <http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/walking-helps-us-think>`_
  goes into the connection between walking, thinking and writing.

* `How Exercise Could Lead to a Better Brain <http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/how-exercise-could-lead-to-a-better-brain.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0>`_
  summarizes that over the last several decades research has pointed to the
  strong relationship between exercise and better brain function.


Meditation
----------
* `How to practice mindfulness meditation <http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-courage-be-present/201001/how-practice-mindfulness-meditation>`_
  covers the basics on how to begin with this form of meditation. Note that
  the goal with mindfulness meditation is not to clear your mind of thoughts
  but to actually allow them to come to you and work with them.

* `How meditation may change the brain <http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/how-meditation-may-change-the-brain/>`_
  covers some of the research done on how meditation can alter brain structure
  for the better, especially in our always-on world.


Caffeine
--------
* `How Caffeine Can Cramp Creativity <http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-caffeine-can-cramp-creativity>`_
  goes into the link between creativity and focus and how caffeine can
  alter that balance.


L-Tyrosine
----------
* Tyrosine has quite a bit of research behind its benefits compared to many
  other common supplements. `This chart <http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/>`_
  lays out how it compares with other supplements and vitamins from an
  evidence perspective.

* Before taking a supplement such as Tyrosine it's a good idea to check with
  a site like `WebMD for drug interactions and side effects <http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1037-tyrosine.aspx?activeingredientid=1037&activeingredientname=tyrosine>`_.


Piracetam & Choline
-------------------
* `Nootropics, their effects, risks and where to get them <https://sites.google.com/site/thinkinginanutshell/nootropics>`_
  is one of the most comprehensive write ups I've found on the topic of
  Nootropics, which includes synthetics like Piracetam.

* Piracetam can be purchased at 
  `Cognitive Nutriton <https://www.cognitivenutrition.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=60>`_ 
  while I usually get choline from `Amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Solgar-Choline-Vegetable-Capsules-Count/dp/B000URVCRI/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1417383612&sr=1-1&keywords=choline+solgar>`_ or
  `Vitamin Shoppe <http://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/solgar-choline-vegicaps-100-veggie-caps/sl-1567#.VHuO66TF95I>`_.


Electrical Brain Stimulation
----------------------------
* Military research under controlled circumstances led to results where
  `electrical brain stimulation beat caffeine <http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/19/electrical-brain-stimulation-caffeine>`_.


Cautionary Tales and Supplemental Reading
-----------------------------------------
* `How Inactivity Changes the Brain <http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/how-inactivity-changes-the-brain/>`_
  goes over the flip side to regular physical activity benefiting the brain:
  inactivity can hamper its performance.

* `The toxins that threaten our brains <http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/the-toxins-that-threaten-our-brains/284466/??>`_
  is an in-depth well-written article on the dangers that common substances
  such as lead, mercury, arsenic and ethanol present to brains, especially
  in children whose brains are still developing.

* `My experiment with smart drugs <http://johannhari.com/2008/05/06/my-experiment-with-smart-drugs/>`_
  provides a perspective from the author on his experiment with the narcolepsy
  drug Provigil.

* `Age-related brain decline begins at 24 <http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/age-related-brain-decline-starts-at-24-1.2611257>`_
  according to research done with Starcraft players.

* `What alcohol actually does to your brain and body <http://lifehacker.com/5684996/what-alcohol-actually-does-to-your-brain-and-body>`_.
  Summary: seriously not good for you.
