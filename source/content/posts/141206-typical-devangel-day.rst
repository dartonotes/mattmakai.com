My Typical Day As A Developer Evangelist
========================================

"*What is a typical day like?*" is one of the most common questions I receive 
about my gig as a 
`Twilio Developer Evangelist <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html>`_. This blog post explains how I schedule
my calendar when I'm in Washington, D.C. on work days.

Daily Structure
---------------
Throughout the past year on the Twilio crew I've learned that my 
secret to keeping happy and productive is to impose regular structure on my
days. Here's how my typical non-traveling weekdays are set up.


730-am(-ish): wake up, write & code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We engineers know that uninterrupted quiet time is the only way to effectively 
code. My uninterrupted time comes in the morning hours between about 7am until
noon. These hours tend to be productive since I'm fortunately one of those 
weird morning people who wakes up with a refreshed mind that's ready to go. 
Morning hours also work well for focused tasks because our headquarters in San 
Francisco is three hours behind D.C. so I know I won't have to take phone 
calls or answer emails from the West Coast until they come online.

Most mornings are a combination of coding *and* writing. 
Since I do both activities in Vim they have a similar creative flow.
Many of the open source projects I work on also go along with a blog post
so writing and coding tasks often overlap. 
For example, I programmed the 
`Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations <https://github.com/mattmakai/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations>`_ Flask web app while writing the 
content for the `code walkthrough blog post <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html>`_.

During the morning hours I often work from the desk in my apartment (shown
in the picture above) or from a coffee shop such as 
`Busboys and Poets <http://www.busboysandpoets.com/>`_ or 
`Compass Coffee <http://compasscoffee.com/>`_.


930am: gym time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I make time to workout every day. Invariably one day per week I will 
have a breakfast meeting, need the extra hours or just plain not feel like
going to the gym. That's the day I skip each week.

The Developer Evangelist role can be tough on your body if you don't take
care of yourself. When you're traveling it can be hard to work out every day.
That's why I ensure a workout happens just about every day I'm not on the road.


11am: continue coding & writing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As soon as I get out of the gym I head home and get back on my laptop. I find
my mind tends to subconsciously chug through coding and writing tasks while
I'm working out. If I was stuck on a bug or a paragraph earlier in the day I
find I can often solve the problem immediately after my workout.


Noon: shower, lunch, head to coworking space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Eventually my day slides into interruption mode. Occasionally it begins with
a lunch meeting where I need to scoot across town to catch up with someone.
If I do not have a lunch meeting then I usually grab lunch from
`Sweetgreen <http://sweetgreen.com/>`_, 
`Chiptole <http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/default.aspx?type=default>`_ [1], or 
`SUNdeVICH <http://sundevich.com/>`_ and take it to my coworking space.


Afternoon: interruption activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From lunch through the afternoon I have what I call "interruption activities"
where I bounce from one thing to another. These activities are reading and 
writing emails, phone calls, Google Hangouts, in-person meetings, code 
reviews and generally responding to requests that come in from teammates and
the external tech community.

During the afternoon I work out of my WeWork coworking space in the
`Shaw neighborhood of the District <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw,_Washington,_D.C.>`_. 
You can see my typical WeWork hot desk set up in the picture below.

Around 2-3pm my mind will often start to wander so I take a walk, catch a 
quick nap or read up on (mostly mindless) tech news via Techmeme or Hacker 
News to catch a breather. Then I'll get back to the interruption activities 
and get prepped for any evening events I have on the calendar.


Evening: tech meetups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When I'm in D.C. I attend on average 1-3 tech meetups a week. Meetups are 
clustered on Wednesday and Thursday nights although there are a few good ones
on Monday and Tuesday evenings as well.

Attending meetups isn't about just sitting around listening to a presenter.
You get out of events what effort you put in. It's important to engage with
your peers and learn more about what they're working on. I'm fortunate to 
have many great friends in the D.C. tech community who I've come to know 
through these tech events. Meetups are a fun way for me to catch up with them 
on their latest work and open source projects, learn how I can help them out 
and discuss programming resources.

I'll often help meetup organizers find space to host their events and 
sponsor food via Twilio funds. I occasionally perform short live coding 
demos with Twilio that are relevant to the audience. For example, at a 
DevOps-focused meetup I'll show off text messsage notifications from an 
`Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/home>`_ playbook 
using the `Twilio module <http://docs.ansible.com/twilio_module.html>`_. Other 
times I'll speak on a programming topic or give a coding workshop like the 
one for 
`Women Who Code DC <http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/events/219004596/>`_
pictured below.

I attend a range of tech meetups but my three favorites throughout 2014 
were:

* `DC Web API Group <http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/>`_ where
  technical and non-technical folks coexist peacefully and learn from each 
  other (yes, seriously it's an amazing event)

* `DC Continuous Delivery <http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-delivery/>`_
  for covering a range of practical DevOps topics (I'm also the co-organizer 
  of this group)

* `DC Hack And Tell <http://dc.hackandtell.org/>`_ for its constant stream
  of fascinating software and hardware hacks
  (shown below is `Travis Hoppe <http://thoppe.github.io/>`_ presenting at 
  the December meetup)

Over time I've found that the worthwhile tech community events in D.C. 
focus more on software development and less on entrepreneurship topics. 
Therefore I prefer to attend meetup centered on programming languages, 
frameworks and software development topics over "startup-ish" drinking events.


Ad hoc Activities
-----------------
That's a peek into my average non-travel day. I accommodate unscheduled 
events, calls, meetings, doctor's appointments and errands as they come up
but try to stick to this formula as closely as possible. The rigid calendar
creates normalcy in what could otherwise be a very unstructured lifestyle.
