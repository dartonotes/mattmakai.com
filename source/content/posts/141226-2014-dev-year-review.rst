My 2014 Software Development Year in Review
===========================================

:date: 2014-12-26

2014 was a solid year for improving my software development abilities. This
year was different from past years because I moved completely out of software 
consulting and into coding open source projects.

This post will briefly cover my highlights from 2014 and go into the insights
I gained from my work throughout the year. I'll cover plans for 2015 in a
future blog post.


2014 Highlights
---------------
The projects and events stand out the most to me from throughout this 
past year were:

  `Lauren Orsini <http://laurenraeorsini.com/>`_, such as 
  `my fish just texted me <http://readwrite.com/2014/04/23/raspberry-pi-connected-home-fish-text-message-twilio>`_, 
  `build your own Yo app clone <http://readwrite.com/2014/07/11/one-click-messaging-app>`_

  AnsibleFest, DC Configuration Management, Women Who Code DC and 
  `many more </talks.html>`_


Codifying My Teaching Style
---------------------------
Throughout the year I tested a hypothesis I came up with in 2013 around
content creation, speaking and coding. My hypothesis was that by focusing my
efforts on interrelated activities ("synergy" for you MBA folks), I would get
better results and feel less scattershot in my work output.

I told the Twilio Developer Evangelism team about this approach and Rob 
Spectre dubbed it the "Makai Triumvirate". Below is a picture representing
what the approach looks like.

When activities are related it allows me to produce much greater
output in coding, writing and talks than if I worked on different topics
in parallel.

A good example of this triumvirate approach is the work I did with Ansible.

* Learned Ansible by deploying existing Python applications

* Built the Underwear Python library to learn more about Ansible's code base

* Coded the Twilio module in Python

* Got the pull request accepted into the Ansible 1.6 release

* Wrote the Ansible Twilio module blog post

* Spoke about Ansible at SF Django, Center for Open Science, DC Configuration 
  Management, AnsibleFest NYC and NoVA Python

* Wrote about Ansible on the Configuration Management page for Full Stack 
  Python


After that work in the first six months of the year I relaxed my focus on 
Ansible. I still use the project all the time for deployments but I moved on
to other topics for coding, speaking and writing.

The triumvirate approach sounds like common sense. However, when you're asked 
by a conference organizer to come up with a technical talk, it's easy to
get excited by a new but unrelated topic and try to create a talk around that
new thing. This focused approach allows me to say "what are the 3 big things I 
will work on this year?" and cut out anything else that is unrelated.


Open Source
-----------
Open source was a much bigger part of my professional life in 2014 than in 
any previous year.

  :width: 100%

The above image shows my my daily open source GitHub contributions through 
December 25 of 2014. I came up with the idea to push an open source commit as 
many days as possible throughout the year. Currently I'm at 282 days in a 
row with my last miss on March 18 (I was up in NYC with our Twilio crew so
I missed that day by accident). 

Overall I should end up having missed 3 days out of 365 this year. I'm happy 
with that streak. It's possible I'll commit less in 2015 but I haven't set a
hard target on my goals after Dec 31 just yet.


Writing
-------
I didn't write a lot on this site since I had a lot going on with 
Full Stack Python and external websites. Here's a quick list of my blog posts
from throughout 2014.

* `Driving Demand for Full Stack Developers <http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/05/driving-demand-for-full-stack-developers.html>`_ 
  on `O'Reilly Radar <http://radar.oreilly.com/>`_

Via the Twilio blog I wrote:

* `Introducing Developer Evangelist Matt Makai <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html>`_

* `Ansible Text Message Notifications with Twilio SMS <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/05/ansible-text-messages-notifications-with-twilio-sms.html>`_

* `How To Set Up GitHub Activity SMS Alerts <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/05/github-pull-request-sms-alerts.html>`_

* `Website SMS Alerts with the Plushcap Python Package: Part 1 <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/website-sms-alerts-with-the-plushcap-python-package-part-1.html>`_

* `Branded MMS Coupon Generation with Python and Twilio <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/10/branded-mms-coupon-generation-with-python-and-twilio.html>`_

* `Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations with Reveal.js, Python and WebSockets <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html>`_

* `The Non-Coderâ€™s Guide For Running the Twilio.org Rapid Response Kit <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/12/non-coders-guide-running-twilio-org-rapid-response-kit.html>`_

Lauren Orsini did the writing for the following three articles but we hacked 
on code together to produce these articles for ReadWrite:
  
* `My Fish Just Texted Me <http://readwrite.com/2014/04/23/raspberry-pi-connected-home-fish-text-message-twilio>`_

* `Friday Fun: Build A Drinking Game With Twilio MMS And Flickr API <http://readwrite.com/2014/09/26/friday-fun-twilio-flickr-api-picture-roulette-drinking-game>`_

* `Create Your Own Obnoxiously Simple Messaging App Just Like Yo <http://readwrite.com/2014/07/11/one-click-messaging-app>`_


That's a Wrap
-------------
I'm happy with how 2014 turned out from a software development standpoint.
Much of my time is spent writing and speaking as well as coding which is
fine by me since I no longer have to worry about the constant billable hour
pressures of being a consultant.

2015 is already shaping up as a killer year. I'll have a separate blog post 
later on my plans for the new year.
