At PyCon 2015 in Montreal, `Kate Heddleston <http://www.kateheddleston.com/>`_
and I presented 
`Choose Your Own WSGI Deployment Adventure <https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/336/>`_.

If you'd like to create your own Choose Your Own Adventure presentations,
all the code is open source and there are blog posts detailing how the code
was written. Here are the links to get you going:

* `Choose Your Own Adventures Git repository <https://github.com/makaimc/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations>`_
* `Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html>`_
* `Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations: Wizard Mode Part 1 of 3 <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/03/choose-your-own-adventures-presentations-wizard-mode-part-1-of-3.html>`_
* Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations: Wizard Mode Part 2 of 3 (coming soon!)
* Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations: Wizard Mode Part 3 of 3 (coming soon!)

For the topics we covered during the talk, and the many other deployment
subjects we did not explain, make sure to check out 
`Full Stack Python <http://www.fullstackpython.com>`_. These pages in
particular will be useful if you want to learn about deploying and
running WSGI applications:

* `Deployments <http://www.fullstackpython.com/deployment.html>`_
* `WSGI servers <http://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html>`_
* `Web analytics <http://www.fullstackpython.com/web-analytics.html>`_
* `Configuration management <http://www.fullstackpython.com/configuration-management.html>`_
* `Web frameworks <http://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html>`_
* `Logging <http://www.fullstackpython.com/logging.html>`_
* `Task queues <http://www.fullstackpython.com/task-queues.html>`_

Also, there's a 
`huge table of contents <http://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html>`_ 
that lays out every subject categories. Don't forget that Full Stack Python
itself is `also open source <https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.com>`_!

We hope that our Choose Your Own WSGI Deployment Adventure talk 
made you laugh and maybe learn a little bit more about Python
web application deployments.
