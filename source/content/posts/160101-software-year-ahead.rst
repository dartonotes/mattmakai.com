My 2016 Year Ahead in Software Development
==========================================

With my 
`2015 software development year in review </2015-software-development-year-review.html>`_ 
done, I'm going to use this post to try something new: looking ahead at the big 
picture for what I want to accomplish in software throughout 2016. While I have a
lot personally to look forward to in this year, I'm going to write strictly
about my professional software career here.

The following goals are the high level objectives for the 366 days in 2016:

* Code, launch and operate my 2016 side project 
  `Plapi <https://github.com/makaimc/plapi>`_

* Inspire and equip fellow developers as a 
  `Twilio Developer Evangelist <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF129ioe8kc>`_

* Release several new updates to 
  `The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments <http://www.deploypython.com/>`_ book
  (free for existing customers)

* Build on the `Full Stack Python <https://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_ foundation
  with daily updates

Let's dig in with more details on what each one of those objectives entails.


Plapi
-----
`The Programming Languages Web API (Plapi) <https://github.com/makaimc/plapi>`_ 
is my `2016 side project </work.html>`_. Plapi consists of three components: 

1. Web application programming interface: api.plapi.io

2. Web application and documentation for the API: www.plapi.io

3. iOS mobile app in App Store (perhaps an Android app if there's time)

Over the 2015 holidays I made a solid start on the API codebase. The web app
is just a skeleton and the iOS mobile app, which will be written in Swift, will
be started within the next few weeks.


Twilio Developer Evangelism
---------------------------
There's a whole lot of work to do in my day job at Twilio. 2016 will be a rush
of inspiring and equipping fellow developers with existing APIs such as
`Voice <https://www.twilio.com/voice>`_, `SMS <https://www.twilio.com/sms>`_, 
`MMS <https://www.twilio.com/mms>`_ and `Client <https://www.twilio.com/client>`_. 
In addition, there's new work to be done now that
`IP Messaging <https://www.twilio.com/ip-messaging>`_ and 
`Video <https://www.twilio.com/video>`_ have opened for public beta. It's an 
incredibly exciting time to be at Twilio. Our Developer Network crew 
(which encompasses Developer Evangelism) is fortunate to be on the front 
lines working with developers helping
them learn how to incorporate the APIs and SDKs into their apps as well as giving 
their feedback to our internal developers.

Much of the work will be based on what we know works, such as:

* Coding and writing new apps and blog posts like 
  `Warm Phone Call Transfers <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/warm-phone-call-transfers-with-python-flask-and-twilio-voice.html>`_ 
  (`Python/Flask code <https://github.com/makaimc/python-warm-transfer-call>`_),
  `City Chat <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/12/city-chat-with-python-django-and-twilio-ip-messaging.html>`_ 
  (`Python/Django code <https://github.com/makaimc/city-chat>`_) and
  `Calculating Net Promoter Score via Twilio SMS <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/01/net-promoter-score-python-sms.html>`_ (`Python code <https://github.com/makaimc/sms-net-promoter-score>`_)

* Putting on one of the best developer conferences: 
  `Signal 2016 <https://www.twilio.com/signal>`_, which will be even better after
  having such a great time at Signal 2015.

* Serving my fellow colleagues on the Developer Network crew in whatever capacity
  they need to continue knocking it out of the park on their executions

* Reaching developers outside my traditional circles, such as by streaming coding
  on Livecoding.tv or Twitch Creative. 



Full Stack Python
-----------------
The `Full Stack Python website <https://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_ was visited by 
over 455,000 users in 2015 according to Google Analytics. I hope to more than double 
the number of readers to over a million throughout 2016 by working on the following
improvements:

1. Improve existing pages with major updates such as new sections and links

2. Write new topic pages based on readers' requests

3. Create new visuals to help readers connect the dots on related subjects, for
   example how reverse proxy servers work with WSGI servers 

If you have suggestions and feedback on the work I'm doing, please tweet me 
`@mattmakai <https://twitter.com/mattmakai>`_ or 
`@fullstackpython <https://twitter.com/fullstackpython>`_ or send me an email
(just a heads up though that I'm pretty slow to respond to most emails since I
try to batch them up and answer them in bulk).


Guide to Python Deployments Book
--------------------------------
I'm working on updates to 
`The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments book <http://www.deploypython.com/>`_
that'll be released in 2016. Some of the updates will be about keeping up with
the latest versions of software used (such as Ansible 2.0), while other updates
will add new content to help readers continue learning about Python web app 
deployments.


Time to Dig In
--------------
With those four big picture priorities on my mind it's time to get started coding
and writing. We'll see in December how it all went.
