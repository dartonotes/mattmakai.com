Hey folks, my name is Matt Makai and I'm a Developer Evangelist with 
Twilio. Joining me on stage is Don Goodman-Wilson, a Senior Developer 
Advocate from Slack. Welcome to "R2-D2 or Skynet?" Today we're going to 
show how to combine the Slack and Twilio APIs and learn about good 
bot-building practices.

Back in March, Twilio launched 
`Tutorials <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/03/tutorials-the-new-documentation-experience-from-twilio.html>`_,
a new feature on the `Twilio documentation <https://www.twilio.com/docs>`_.
If you're a developer working on common features that incorporate Twilio,
such as two-factor authentication or building an interactive voice response
(IVR) system, you could find a tutorial with the code in your programming 
language along with an entire step-by-step walkthrough for how to add that
feature to your application.

The launch involved about a dozen people at Twilio within the
`Developer Network team <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF129ioe8kc>`_.
Even with a reasonable size team we ran into issues manually scaling our
communication across everyone on the team, such as when blog posts were 
going live.

Twilio's mission is to empower developers to build the future of 
communications. Internally, we use many tools to help us accomplish that
mission.

One of those tools is Slack, which Twilio uses company-wide. A new Slack 
channel was born with everyone who was on point for the launch.

Over one hundred tutorials checked and cross-checked for accuracy both
in the tutorial prose and the code.

Now, this certainly was far from the most complicated launch Twilio has 
executed. Products like Video and IP Messaging require a boatloads of 
communication across the entire company - similarly, in many time zones 
across the world.

Plus, many of us are on the road at events, or heads down coding.

There is definitely a better way to handle all these logistics. The
answer is spreadsheets. Lots and lots of spreadsheets.

No, not really spreadsheets. We're *software developers*. We know most 
spreadsheets are just terrible wannabe databases with no schema or 
data constraints. What we could use are smart bots in Slack with some 
intelligence based on our launch schedule and the list of people involved.

How would this Slack Bot scheduling utopia work? Well, rather than just
talk about it, let's launch something together right now.

We, as in everyone in this entire room, are going to launch a Python and 
Twilio-powered Slack bot with automated scheduling magic, called 
Draw the Owl Bot.

Here are the items we're launching today: open source GitHub project,
publish a Twilio blog post, social promote with @twilio and @fullstackpython.

Here's how our bot architecture works.

We need a Slack channel to coordinate our launch, so we created one at
draw-the-owl-bot.slack.com. Now we need your help. Get out your phones.
Join the channel by texting (202) 555-1234.

Ok, here is our #general channel filling up. ("/launch-participants").

Time to roll up our sleeves and dig in to write some bot code.

Our Slackbot should start out friendly, with helpful nudges like 
R2-D2's bleeps and boops.

...but the bot goes full Skynet mode if you just never respond.
