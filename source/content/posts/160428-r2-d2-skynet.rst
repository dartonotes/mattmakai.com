**R2-D2 or Skynet? Combining Slack Bots with the Twilio API**
by Matt Makai (Twilio) and Don Goodman-Wilson (Slack)

Back in March, Twilio launched a new 
`Tutorials by Twilio <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/03/tutorials-the-new-documentation-experience-from-twilio.html>`_ 
format. The tutorials made my developer senses tingle, in a good way. Each 
tutorial provided idiomatic code for every major programming language 
along with the frameworks that developers commonly use in those ecosystems.

Twilio's 
`Developer Network team <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF129ioe8kc>`_
is globally distributed, so we needed some handy software to
coordinate between nine time zones.

We of course turned to Slack, which Twilio uses company-wide. A new Slack 
channel named *team-docsweek* was born with everyone who was on point for the 
launch.

Now, how hard could a launch be? Well, here's a quick list of all the
things that had to come together to make this work out for us.
Six live streams by different Developer Evangelists throughout the week.

Eight blog posts going live in a specific order.

Over one hundred tutorials checked and cross-checked for accuracy both
in the tutorial prose and the code.

Every tutorial open sourced on GitHub with appropriate READMEs and
hooked up to continuous integration.

Clearly all this manual intervention isn't going to scale past a half a 
dozen people. It mostly worked, but there was way too much manual "hey, 
you there? hey, you ready to put that post up so we can do this other 
thing?"

Now, this certainly was far from the most complicated launch Twilio has 
executed. Products like Video and IP Messaging require a boatloads of 
communication across the entire company - similarly, in many time zones 
across the world.

Plus, many of us are on the road at events, or heads down coding.

There is definitely a better way to handle all these logistics. The
answer is spreadsheets. Lots and lots of spreadsheets.

No, not really spreadsheets. We're *software developers*. We know most 
spreadsheets are just terrible wannabe databases with no schema or 
data constraints. What we could use are smart bots in Slack with some 
intelligence based on our launch schedule and the list of people involved.

How would this Slack Bot scheduling utopia work? Well, rather than just
talk about it, let's launch something together right now.

We, as in everyone in this entire room, are going to launch a Python and 
Twilio-powered Slack bot with automated scheduling magic, called 
Draw the Owl Bot.

Here are the items we're launching today: open source GitHub project,
publish a Twilio blog post, social promote with @twilio and @fullstackpython.

We need a Slack channel to coordinate our launch, so we created one at
draw-the-owl-bot.slack.com. Now we need your help. Get out your phones.
Join the channel by texting (202) 555-1234.

Ok, here is our #general channel filling up. ("/launch-participants").

Time to roll up our sleeves and dig in to write some bot code.

Our Slackbot should start out friendly, with helpful nudges like 
R2-D2's bleeps and boops.

...but the bot goes full Skynet mode if you just never respond.
