My 2017 Year Ahead in Software Development

My 
`look back at what I accomplished professionally in 2016 is complete </2016-software-development-year-review.html>`_,
so with this post I'm looking ahead at my software development goals for 
2017 along with the programming ecosystems I will be coding in. The three
areas I will be focused on in 2017 are continued work on existing projects,
tutorial videos and reading open source code.


Existing Projects
-----------------
It is possible to get wrapped up in thinking about the next 365 days as
a wide-open expanse just waiting to be filled with new side projects. 
However, the reality is that a lot of my time outside my 
`day gig <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html>`_
is going to be taken up by three existing side projects:

1. `Full Stack Python <https://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_
2. `Python for Entrepreneurs <https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business>`_
3. `The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments <http://www.deploypython.com/>`_

The highest priority work for the next couple of months will be finishing
my chapters in the Python for Entrepreneurs video course I'm working on with
`Michael Kennedy <https://twitter.com/mkennedy>`_. I will divide my time 
between marketing and content updates for the video course and my 
deployments book once the video course is completed and fully released (it 
is currently in early access). Full Stack Python daily updates with new 
resources, pages and descriptions will continue for the foreseeable future.


Software Development Tutorial Videos
------------------------------------
In addition to the Python for Entrepreneurs video course, I started creating
short tutorial videos for Twilio in 2016. The quality and quantity of those
types of videos will ramp up significantly in 2017 as I continue to get
comfortable with the tools (Camtasia, Audacity, external microphone, etc).

Most, if not all, of these videos will appear on 
`Twilio's YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/TeamTwilio>`_
and the 
`How to Use Twilio <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqrz4nXepkz63z1y4-oHfZHWy11gSoAn0>`_ 
playlist.


Reading Code
------------
Reading and analyzing open source code can be a great way to become a 
better programmer, yet I find most of the time I only look at my own code
and that of my Twilio colleagues!

I'd like to be more intentional about reading code, which will hopefully
culminate in a series of blog posts on popular Python open source projects
where I "tear them down" (in a hardware-style tear down not an insulting
takedown), use the Python debugger to better understand what's going on under
the hood and explain the nuts and bolts to readers. I'll experiment with
this style in the first half of 2017 then look at what's working and not
working about it before determining how to proceed in the second half of
the year.


Programming Ecosystems
----------------------
Continuing my work on existing projects, creating video tutorials and
reading code are my major focus areas for 2017.

In 2016 I spent about 75% of my time working in Python and about 25% in
Swift. In 2017 my ecosystems will likely change again, with a significant
reduction in Python programming to about 40%, Swift around 25% and 
Java with a significant uptick at 35%. Most of the Java and Swift work will 
be done for Twilio while Python will remain my primary side project language
with an occasional Twilio coding project in Python. The Java and Python 
projects will be for web development while Swift will be used for mobile
development.

Onward!
-------
Those are my goals and expected programming ecosystems for 2017, time for
me to get back at it!
