This talk shows that &quot;full stack&quot; is about having your software developers
trade depth for breadth. In addition, we'll cover what the server side stack
looks like for Python web application deployments and why web APIs are
increasingly important for the full stack trend.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="/presentations/pelican-static-sites.html">Static Sites With Pelican</a></h3>
<p>Pelican is a Python-powered static website generator that combines
a markup language such a ReStructuredText or Markdown with Jinja2
templates to output HTML pages. Those pages combined with CSS, images,
JavaScript, and third party services can be hosted for free or low cost
on services such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 with CloudFront. This talk
goes over what Pelican does and how it can help you instantly scale
a static website to virtually unlimited traffic for free.</p>

<p>Text messages are one of the best communication methods for sending time
sensitive information and alerting users to take immediate action. Twilio
makes sending Short Message Service (SMS) messages easy with a few lines of

<h3><a class="reference external" href="/presentations/dc-cont-intg-delivery-devops-service.html">DevOps Deployments-as-a-Service</a></h3>
<p>What are the best software-as-a-service platforms for building and deploying
your code? How can they help you quickly get a project off the ground and
sustain best practices as your codebase continues to scale? This talk
answers these questions and more by introducing you to services such as
Circle CI, Travis CI, factor.io, Code Climate, and many others, which take
the burden off setting up the infrastructure yourself. The talk will
balance out the discussion with the downsides to these platforms and
ways to avoid being locked in to declining providers.</p>

<p>How do you quickly get up to speed on an existing Django project codebase?
You're eventually going to run into a large unfamiliar codebase whether
you're the new developer on a team with an established codebase
or just working with code you wrote awhile back. This talk covers steps you
absolutely must take to identify and triage existing issues, stablize the
codebase, and gently guide the project towards &quot;this is amazing!&quot; status.</p>
