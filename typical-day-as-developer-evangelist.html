        <a href="/typical-day-as-developer-evangelist.html">My Typical Day As A Developer Evangelist</a>
    </h2> 
    <p>&quot;<em>What is a typical day like?</em>&quot; is one of the most common questions I receive
about my gig as a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html">Twilio Developer Evangelist</a>. This blog post explains how I schedule
my calendar when I'm in Washington, D.C. on work days.</p>
<div class="section" id="daily-structure">
<h2>Daily Structure</h2>
<p>Throughout the past year on the Twilio crew I've learned that my
secret to keeping happy and productive is to impose regular structure on my
days. Here's how my typical non-traveling weekdays (and many Saturdays) are
set up.</p>
<div class="section" id="am-ish-wake-up-write-code">
<h3>730-am(-ish): wake up, write &amp; code</h3>
<p>We engineers know that uninterrupted quiet time is the only way to effectively
code. My uninterrupted time comes in the morning hours between about 7am until
noon. These hours tend to be productive since I'm fortunately one of those
weird morning people who wakes up with a refreshed mind that's ready to go.
Morning hours also work well for focused tasks because our headquarters in San
Francisco is three hours behind D.C. so I know I won't have to take phone
calls or answer emails from the West Coast until they come online.</p>
<p>Most mornings are a combination of coding <em>and</em> writing.
Since I do both activities in Vim they have a similar creative flow.
Many of the open source projects I work on also go along with a blog post
so writing and coding tasks often overlap.
For example, I programmed the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/makaimc/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations">Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations</a> Flask web app while writing the
content for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html">code walkthrough blog post</a>.</p>
<img alt="The simple desk with external monitor I use to work from home" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/home-desk.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>During the morning hours I often work from the desk in my apartment (shown
in the picture above) or from a coffee shop such as
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.busboysandpoets.com/">Busboys and Poets</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://compasscoffee.com/">Compass Coffee</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="am-gym-time">
<h3>930am: gym time</h3>
<p>I make time to workout every day. Invariably one day per week I'll either
have a breakfast meeting, need the extra hours or just plain not feel like
going to the gym. That's the day I skip each week.</p>
<p>The Developer Evangelist role can be tough on your body if you don't take
care of yourself. When you're traveling it can be hard to work out every day.
That's why I ensure a workout happens just about every day I'm not on the road.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="am-continue-coding-writing">
<h3>11am: continue coding &amp; writing</h3>
<p>As soon as I get out of the gym I head home and get back on my laptop. I find
my mind tends to subconsciously chug through coding and writing tasks while
I'm working out. If I was stuck on a bug or a paragraph earlier in the day I
find I can often solve the problem immediately after my workout.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="noon-shower-lunch-head-to-coworking-space">
<h3>Noon: shower, lunch, head to coworking space</h3>
<p>Eventually my day slides into interruption mode. Occasionally it begins with
a lunch meeting where I need to scoot across town to catch up with someone.
If I do not have a lunch meeting then I usually grab lunch from
<a class="reference external" href="http://sweetgreen.com/">Sweetgreen</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/default.aspx?type=default">Chiptole</a> [1], or
<a class="reference external" href="http://sundevich.com/">SUNdeVICH</a> and take it to my coworking space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="afternoon-interruption-activities">
<h3>Afternoon: interruption activities</h3>
<p>From lunch through the afternoon I have what I call &quot;interruption activities&quot;
where I bounce from one thing to another. These activities are reading and
writing emails, phone calls, Google Hangouts, in-person meetings, code
reviews and generally responding to requests that come in from teammates and
the external tech community.</p>
<p>During this time I generally work out of my WeWork coworking space in
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw,_Washington,_D.C.">Shaw</a>. You can see
my typical WeWork hot desk set up in the picture below.</p>
<img alt="WeWork coworking space spot" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/wework.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Around 2-3pm my mind will often start to wander so I generally take a walk,
nap or just catch up on tech news via Techmeme or Hacker News to catch a
breather. Then I'll get back to the interruption activities and get prepped
for any evening events I have on the calendar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evening-tech-meetups">
<h3>Evening: tech meetups</h3>
<p>When I'm in DC I generally attend 1-3 tech meetups a week. Meetups are
clustered on Wednesday and Thursday nights although there's a few good ones
on Monday and Tuesday evenings as well.</p>
<img alt="DC Hack And Tell meetup picture from December 8, 2014" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/dc-hack-and-tell.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>I attend a range of tech meetups but my favorites throughout 2014 were
<a class="reference external" href="http://dc.hackandtell.org/">DC Hack And Tell</a> (shown above),
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/">DC Web API Group</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-delivery/">DC Continuous Delivery</a>
(I'm the co-organizer of this group so I work to make it enjoyable). The best
DC tech meetups focus on software development and less on entrepreneurship
topics so I prefer to attend meetup like Django District over a &quot;startup-ey&quot;
drinking event.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="life-happens">
<h2>Life Happens</h2>
<p>That's a peek into my average non-travel day. I accommodate unscheduled
events, calls, meetings, doctor's appointments and errands as they come up
but try to stick to this formula as closely as possible. The rigid calendar
creates normalcy in what could otherwise be a very unstructured lifestyle.</p>
