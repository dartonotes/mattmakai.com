        <a href="/typical-day-as-developer-evangelist.html">My Typical Day As A Developer Evangelist</a>
    </h2> 
    <p>&quot;<em>What is a typical day like?</em>&quot; is one of the most common questions I receive
about my gig as a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html">Twilio Developer Evangelist</a>. This blog post explains how I schedule
my calendar when I'm in Washington, D.C. on work days.</p>
<div class="section" id="daily-structure">
<h2>Daily Structure</h2>
<p>Throughout the past year on the Twilio crew I've learned that my
secret to keeping happy and productive is to impose regular structure on my
days. Here's how my typical non-traveling weekdays are set up.</p>
<div class="section" id="am-ish-wake-up-write-code">
<h3>730-am(-ish): wake up, write &amp; code</h3>
<p>We engineers know that uninterrupted quiet time is the only way to effectively
code. My uninterrupted time comes in the morning hours between about 7am until
noon. These hours tend to be productive since I'm fortunately one of those
weird morning people who wakes up with a refreshed mind that's ready to go.
Morning hours also work well for focused tasks because our headquarters in San
Francisco is three hours behind D.C. so I know I won't have to take phone
calls or answer emails from the West Coast until they come online.</p>
<p>Most mornings are a combination of coding <em>and</em> writing.
Since I do both activities in Vim they have a similar creative flow.
Many of the open source projects I work on also go along with a blog post
so writing and coding tasks often overlap.
For example, I programmed the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/makaimc/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations">Choose Your Own Adventure Presentations</a> Flask web app while writing the
content for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html">code walkthrough blog post</a>.</p>
<img alt="The simple desk with external monitor I use to work from home" class="space-me" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/home-desk.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>During the morning hours I often work from the desk in my apartment (shown
in the picture above) or from a coffee shop such as
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.busboysandpoets.com/">Busboys and Poets</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://compasscoffee.com/">Compass Coffee</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="am-gym-time">
<h3>930am: gym time</h3>
<p>I make time to workout every day. Invariably one day per week I will
have a breakfast meeting, need the extra hours or just plain not feel like
going to the gym. That's the day I skip each week.</p>
<p>The Developer Evangelist role can be tough on your body if you don't take
care of yourself. When you're traveling it can be hard to work out every day.
That's why I ensure a workout happens just about every day I'm not on the road.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="am-continue-coding-writing">
<h3>11am: continue coding &amp; writing</h3>
<p>As soon as I get out of the gym I head home and get back on my laptop. I find
my mind tends to subconsciously chug through coding and writing tasks while
I'm working out. If I was stuck on a bug or a paragraph earlier in the day I
find I can often solve the problem immediately after my workout.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="noon-shower-lunch-head-to-coworking-space">
<h3>Noon: shower, lunch, head to coworking space</h3>
<p>Eventually my day slides into interruption mode. Occasionally it begins with
a lunch meeting where I need to scoot across town to catch up with someone.
If I do not have a lunch meeting then I usually grab lunch from
<a class="reference external" href="http://sweetgreen.com/">Sweetgreen</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/default.aspx?type=default">Chiptole</a> [1], or
<a class="reference external" href="http://sundevich.com/">SUNdeVICH</a> and take it to my coworking space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="afternoon-interruption-activities">
<h3>Afternoon: interruption activities</h3>
<p>From lunch through the afternoon I have what I call &quot;interruption activities&quot;
where I bounce from one thing to another. These activities are reading and
writing emails, phone calls, Google Hangouts, in-person meetings, code
reviews and generally responding to requests that come in from teammates and
the external tech community.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I work out of my WeWork coworking space in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw,_Washington,_D.C.">Shaw neighborhood of the District</a>.
You can see my typical WeWork hot desk set up in the picture below.</p>
<img alt="WeWork coworking space spot" class="space-me" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/wework.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Around 2-3pm my mind will often start to wander so I take a walk, catch a
quick nap or read up on (mostly mindless) tech news via Techmeme or Hacker
News to catch a breather. Then I'll get back to the interruption activities
and get prepped for any evening events I have on the calendar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evening-tech-meetups">
<h3>Evening: tech meetups</h3>
<p>When I'm in D.C. I attend on average 1-3 tech meetups a week. Meetups are
clustered on Wednesday and Thursday nights although there are a few good ones
on Monday and Tuesday evenings as well.</p>
<p>Attending meetups isn't about just sitting around listening to a presenter.
You get out of events what effort you put in. It's important to engage with
your peers and learn more about what they're working on. I'm fortunate to
have many great friends in the D.C. tech community who I've come to know
through these tech events. Meetups are a fun way for me to catch up with them
on their latest work and open source projects, learn how I can help them out
and discuss programming resources.</p>
<p>I'll often help meetup organizers find space to host their events and
sponsor food via Twilio funds. I occasionally perform short live coding
demos with Twilio that are relevant to the audience. For example, at a
DevOps-focused meetup I'll show off text messsage notifications from an
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> playbook
using the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.ansible.com/twilio_module.html">Twilio module</a>. Other
times I'll speak on a programming topic or give a coding workshop like the
one for
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/events/219004596/">Women Who Code DC</a>
pictured below.</p>
<img alt="Twilio workshop at Women Who Code DC" class="space-me" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/wwdc.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>I attend a range of tech meetups but my three favorites throughout 2014
were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/">DC Web API Group</a> where
technical and non-technical folks coexist peacefully and learn from each
other (yes, seriously it's an amazing event)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-delivery/">DC Continuous Delivery</a>
for covering a range of practical DevOps topics (I'm also the co-organizer
of this group)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://dc.hackandtell.org/">DC Hack And Tell</a> for its constant stream
of fascinating software and hardware hacks
(shown below is <a class="reference external" href="http://thoppe.github.io/">Travis Hoppe</a> presenting at
the December meetup)</li>
</ul>
<img alt="DC Hack And Tell meetup picture from December 8, 2014" class="space-me" src="/source/static/img/141201-devangel-day/dc-hack-and-tell.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Over time I've found that the worthwhile tech community events in D.C.
focus more on software development and less on entrepreneurship topics.
Therefore I prefer to attend meetup centered on programming languages,
frameworks and software development topics over &quot;startup-ish&quot; drinking events.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ad-hoc-activities">
<h2>Ad hoc Activities</h2>
<p>That's a peek into my average non-travel day. I accommodate unscheduled
events, calls, meetings, doctor's appointments and errands as they come up
but try to stick to this formula as closely as possible. The rigid calendar
creates normalcy in what could otherwise be a very unstructured lifestyle.</p>
