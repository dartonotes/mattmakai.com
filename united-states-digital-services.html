    </h2> 
    <p>I paused for a few moments this morning in the Boston rain and took this
picture. Many thoughts have swirled in my head about the new
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/08/11/white-house-launches-u-s-digital-service-with-healthcare-gov-fixer-at-the-helm/">U.S. Digital Services</a>
group publicly announced earlier this week.</p>
<img alt="Boston during a hard downpouring rain" src="/source/static/img/140813-us-digital-services/boston.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Boston is a good place for contemplating how the government must always do
its best to be accountable to the People rather than its own interests. A
few moments after I took that picture I walked by the graveyard where Sam
Adams, the Boston Massacre victims and many of Ben Franklin's family are
buried. Ol' Ben himself is buried in Philadelphia but he was born in Boston.</p>
<p>I felt like Mr. Franklin's ideas would tie together nebulous thoughts in my
head for a coherent blog post. I quickly web searched for Ben's famous quotes.
This one struck me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.&quot;</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking about recommendations for how U.S. Digital Services can
hire talented developers that otherwise would avoid public sector work. I
learned about the group's creation in conversations after our
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/twilio-white-house-twilio-org-rapid-response-kit-nt.html">Twilio Rapid Response Kit demo</a>
at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/07/29/watch-white-house-innovation-disaster-response-and-recovery-demo-day%20">White House Innovation Disaster Response Day</a>
a couple of weeks ago and finally found time in Boston to write this post.</p>
<p>Until Ben's quote though I wasn't sure what to think but reading the above
quote nails the approach I'd take to staff up the Digital Services team. The
best software developers are looking for more than just a paycheck. They are
looking to create elegant solutions to hard problems. The
best software developers want to write software worth reading and executing.</p>
<p>Well, no shit right? Every startup and government agency talks about how they
are &quot;changing the world&quot; and &quot;doing things that matter.&quot; But few of them are
places worth working because the talk is hollow. Here's how Digital Services
(or any organization) can prove they have an environment that deserves to
employ some of the country's best technical minds.</p>
<div class="section" id="open-source-everything">
<h2>Open source everything</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/whitehouse/playbook">This playbook</a> is a great start.
Make sure it's not just documentation but also <strong>code</strong> as CFPB has done
with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cfpb/collab">collab Python source code</a> and 18F
with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/18F/answers">answers Ruby source code</a>.</p>
<p>There's something about knowing your code is open to the rest of the software
development world via open source that makes her feel she's held accountable
and writing something that matters.</p>
<p>A public visualization of how much code at Digital Services is currently open
source, how much is private and how much is in process to be open sourced
would be awesome. Figure out a way to make that dynamically generated so it
doesn't have to be updated in a spreadsheet by hand. Automate the transparency
rather than making it a manual process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="host-tech-meetups">
<h2>Host tech meetups</h2>
<p>We have all these massive government buildings and the tech community
struggles to find event space for tech meetups such as DC Python, DC
Continuous Delivery, Ruby User's Group and so on. There has to be a way to
cut the red tape and have at least one facility be available for tech events
of 80-120 people. You're hosting so give us updates on all the amazing work
you're doing at Digital Services.</p>
<p>Also, ensure the space is kept for real tech events that focus on software
development, not the garbage recruiter-run events where passion for programming
is nowhere to be found (I'm looking at you, TechMotion).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-review-with-outside-developers">
<h2>Code review with outside developers</h2>
<p>The code is open source which is a start. The next step is to bring in
awesome developers from the best tech companies with people in DC like
TrackMaven, SocialRadar, BoundlessGeo, MapBox and SmartThings to sit down for
in-person visits. Conduct hour-long free code review sessions for constructive
code and documentation feedback. 18F does something like this with their
API feedback sessions. Apply that concept to code reviews.</p>
<p>It's like jury duty for software developers.</p>
<p>I may need to work on the above analogy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hire-short-term-consultants-only">
<h2>Hire short-term consultants only</h2>
<p>Use consultants only for niche skills such as information security in less than
8 week durations, if at all. Consultants are parasites. I used to be one.
Even though I tried to do good work it was impossible to properly serve
the dual masters of client and consulting company.</p>
<p>Make information on the number and percentage of consultants at Digital
Services publicly assessible. Actually it may be worth creating a webpage
dashboard of all the things software developers care about so they can see
how an organization stacks up in various attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ensure-great-gigs-for-departing-developers">
<h2>Ensure great gigs for departing developers</h2>
<p>When developers eventually depart from Digital Services they should be getting
gigs at private companies that have nothing to do with government sector
work. If developers are coming out of Digital Services
in a couple of years and being hired by Bay Area companies that's a
positive indictator that the program is at least hiring the right talent.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>That's my initial incomplete recommendations list. But each of those things
are really difficult for most government organizations to do at all. The above
items are a good litmus test for whether Digital Services is for real or
will end up perpetuating the quagmire of overcomplicated government software
systems maintained by an army of overpaid consultants.</p>
<p>Let's hope that Digital Services either writes some code worth reading or
creates some software worth writing about.</p>
